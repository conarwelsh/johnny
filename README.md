# Johnny's Learning Site

We can both work together on this site, and I can continually give you different ways to improve the setup.  It may seem like overkill with all the stuff that is currently in here, but trust me it will make more sense as you go along.

## Markdown

This file is written in `Markdown`.  Any file that has the extension of `.md` is a markdown file.  You can google in depth what markdown actually is, but more or less it is a concise way to write HTML for documentation type sites.  Github in particular uses it heavily, but you can find it all over the internet.

## GitHub Collaboration Tools

- **Issues**: Notice that there is a tab at the top of this page called `Issues`.  Here anyone can create "issues".  It is basically a help ticket system.  Anyone can add comments, reference code, reference commits or changes, etc etc etc.  This is an awesome tool, and I am going to use this tool to help you improve your code, and point out things you should see, so constantly be checking this area.
- **Projects**: There is also the `Projects` tab, this is similar to the issues tab, but is better used for future work.  Think of the Issues tab as being used to report and track bugs, or things to do with existing code... whereas Projects is used to plan for future code plans, and assigning tasks to users.  I will use this to set you up with work to do to improve the site and learn new things.  We will be using a project structure called KanBan.  This is a very popular structure, and is used by most software companies.  I suggest a good google on this one to read why its effective, and the general idea of the approach.  You will most certainly encounter this in real life if you enter this industry.
- **Wiki**: We probably will not use this very much, but it is a useful place to store information about a project.  I may use this to store information that you can continually reference going forward.  In fact now that I am typing this, I think a good first project for you would be to create a wiki page that will include all of the links for documentation sites regarding different tools that we will be using throughout this project.
- Other than the forementioned tools, GitHub has a ton of really valuable stuff. I highly suggest you explore as much as possible.  In particular, a tool called `gists` is pretty cool, and a great thing to start using now, as it will just grow and grow as you get more advanced.

## Site Libraries

Below are some of the tools we are starting with to give us a headstart and get past the boring shit.  While these are great for covering the basics in a good manner for you, it is imperative that you fully understand what is being done here, so I implore you to start with the `index.html` file, and see which files it is linking to, and follow the rabbit hole until you at least have a basic understanding of what is happening.

#### Html5 Boilerplate

The folder structure I have here I merely downloaded from [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/).  It uses a handful of best practices for creating a website to give you a good starting point for a new project.  We will use this as a base to build from, even though most of what is here will disappear eventually as the site gets more complex.

> Documentation site for HTML5 Boilerplate is [here](https://html5boilerplate.com/)

> There is also a folder in this project called `doc` and it includes a bunch of markdown files documenting the structure of the HTML5 Boilerplate, and their design decisions.

#### Bootstrap

A couple dudes from Twitter created a toolkit for CSS called ` Bootstrap`.  It is ubiquitous on the internet, so many sites use it.  I personally consider it to be bloated, ugly and slow... but until you learn enough to make your own opinion on the matter, it is a great tool.
