# Johnny's Learning Site

We can both work together on this site, and I can continually give you different ways to improve the setup.  It may seem like overkill with all the stuff that is currently in here, but trust me it will make more sense as you go along.

## Markdown

This file is written in `Markdown`.  Any file that has the extension of `.md` is a markdown file.  You can google in depth what markdown actually is, but more or less it is a concise way to write HTML for documentation type sites.  Github in particular uses it heavily, but you can find it all over the internet.

## Site Components

Below are some of the tools we are starting with to give us a headstart and get past the boring shit.  While these are great for covering the basics in a good manner for you, it is imperative that you fully understand what is being done here, so I implore you to start with the `index.html` file, and see which files it is linking to, and follow the rabbit hole until you at least have a basic understanding of what is happening.

#### Html5 Boilerplate

The folder structure I have here I merely downloaded from [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/).  It uses a handful of best practices for creating a website to give you a good starting point for a new project.  We will use this as a base to build from, even though most of what is here will disappear eventually as the site gets more complex.

#### Bootstrap

A couple dudes from Twitter created a toolkit for CSS called ` Bootstrap`.  It is ubiquitous on the internet, so many sites use it.  I personally consider it to be bloated, ugly and slow... but until you learn enough to make your own opinion on the matter, it is a great tool.
